'Home' is a personal project that allows simple configuration of Raspberry Pi's to do common tasks around the house
- Humidity/Temperature Sensors (DHT11, DHT22, AM2302)
- GPIO control (in/out)
- Pi Camera
- Pushbullet notification (text, image)
- MQTT (for communication with other devices)
- File logging

Example uses:
- Door monitor
    - Send Pushbullet/MQTT messages on state change
    - Capture Pi Camera image on state change, can send as notification
- Door control (i.e. garage door)
    - Use GPIO to control relay
    - Receive commands via MQTT
- Security Camera
    - Take images periodically or on demand via MQTT commands
- Humidity/environment sensing
    - Configurable sensor read frequency
    - Configurable temperature units
    - Send MQTT/Pushbullet messages on new reads

In addition, the MQTT communication can be used to communicate with home automation services
such as Home Assistant. This provides a central location to view all sensor states and control the devices.

Target Python Version: 3.4
- Should work on any 3.x

On RPi, some ffi system packages are required to install the Pushbullet Python module
- sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-cffi libffi-dev
